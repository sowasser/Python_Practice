"""
Data captured from video of fish (sticklebacks or zebrafish) using LoggerPro.
The position of each fish is captured for selected frames of the video.

In this script, the data are imported and cleaned, then position is extracted
for statistical analyses. The data structure for this analysis method is
completely different than that in the tracking_import.py script. The results
can then be exported to R for graphing if you're a ggplot fan, or eventually
you (and by you I mean I) can figure out how to make graphs in Python. :Ã¾

The functions for the statistical analyses are in the tracking_functions.py
script and are as follows:
    * Mean distance from the centroid
    * Mean nearest neighbour distance
    * Shoal area (area of the convex hull)
    * Polarization - can be included for tracking data with 2 points per fish
