"""
Model of shoaling behavior based on the Boids model by Craig Reynolds in 1986,
using the basic code provided in the Flocker example of the Mesa framework for
agent-based modelling in Python. This model is based on 3 parameters that each
agent follows:
    1. Attraction to other agents (cohere),
    2. Avoidance of other agents (separation),
    3. Alignment with other agents (match_velocity).

These rules are based on the neighbours each agent perceives within their
'vision' radius. This is a geometrical distance, rather than topological
(Mann et al. 2011). Another version of this model is being constructed
for the topological (set number of neighbours at any distance).

Data are collected in the data_collectors.py script and are:
    1. Polarization: a function returning the median absolute deviation of
       agent heading from the mean heading of the group
    2. Nearest neighbour distance: the mean distance of the 5 nearest agents,
       determined using a k-distance tree.
    3. Shoal Area: convex hull
    4. Mean Distance From Centroid

The model is based on an toroidal (unbounded & wrapping), 2D area. Later
versions will be 3D, bounded and include obstacles, environmental gradients,
and agents with goal-, food-, or safety-seeking behaviour.

A visualization of the model in an HTML object is in shoal_model_viz.py
