# ODD for Shoaling Model

## Overview

### Purpose
To accurately represent a mackerel shoal to provide information on overall shape and composition under different conditions in order to improve acoustic stock assessments. The goal is to have this model be _actually_ useful for fisheries managers by providing a better estimate of population levels. Acoustic measurements are always an estimate and are especially difficult for Atlantic mackerel (_Scomber scombrus_) as they do not have a swim bladder.
